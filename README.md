A RAG and Agent-based health chatbot built with LangChain
# Health Chatbot Agent ü©∫

This project is an advanced, conversational AI health assistant built using LangChain, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and an agentic framework. It is designed to provide accurate health information by leveraging both structured and unstructured data sources.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Tool Agent:** The agent can intelligently decide which tool to use based on the user's query:
  - **Hospital Directory:** Finds hospitals in any Indian state and can filter by pincode.
  - **Vaccination Schedule:** Provides official vaccination schedules for infants and pregnant women.
  - **Health Knowledge Base (RAG):** Answers general health questions about symptoms, diseases, and conditions by searching a vectorized database of medical documents.
- **Conversational Memory:** Remembers the context of the conversation to answer follow-up questions.
- **Interactive & User-Friendly:** Provides human-like, conversational responses instead of raw data.
- **Zero Hallucination:** Grounded in provided documents and data to ensure factual accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework:** LangChain
- **LLM:** Llama-3 (via Groq API for high-speed inference)
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB
- **Embedding Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`
